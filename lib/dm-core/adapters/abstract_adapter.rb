    # Specific adapters extend this class and implement
    # methods for creating, reading, updating and deleting records.
    #
    # Adapters may only implement method for reading or (less common case)
    # writing. Read only adapter may be useful when one needs to work
    # with legacy data that should not be changed or web services that
    # only provide read access to data (from Wordnet and Medline to
    # Atom and RSS syndication feeds)
    #
    # Note that in case of adapters to relational databases it makes
    # sense to inherit from DataObjectsAdapter class.
